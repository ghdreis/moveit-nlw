<h2 id="objective" > ðŸŽ¯ Objective </h2>

Move.it was developed for time management based on the pomodoro technique, dividing the work into 25-minute periods, and a challenge is proposed in its intervals, which consists of an exercise aimed at helping those who spend a lot of time working in front of a computer. Each challenge has its XP points and, accumulating the points, you level up.

The layout of original move.it is available <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/wXWU7KGGF0Vw2QzFKwbJ2K/Move.it-2.0-(Copy)?node-id=160%3A2761">here</a>.
